I am a 23 year old Software Engineer from Nigeria who loves to cook. I mean i love cooking a lot. I am currently working at Technology partner with 7 startups, working on client centered data solutions along side a couple of awesome engineers, designers and other creatives. I am passionate about doing research in artificial intelligence, machine learning, natural science and space exploration.

I am the captain of this ship. This ship 🛰️ sails at __27,580 km/h__ (or 17,130 mph). Crazy, isn't it? Well grab the firm handle closest to you because we are gonna go warp speed to know my universe.
